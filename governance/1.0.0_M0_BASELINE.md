# FUSE 1.0.0 M0 Baseline Audit

Status: Complete (2026-02-28)  
Source contract: `../spec/1.0.0_STABILITY_CONTRACT.md`  
Tracking plan: `./1.0.0_PLAN.md`

This document is the M0 deliverable for `v0.7.0 -> v1.0.0` planning:

1. contract-clause gap matrix
2. ownership map
3. tracking checklist linked to plan evidence

## Tracking Checklist (Issue Surrogate)

Repo-local tracking checklist, linked to milestone evidence blocks in `governance/1.0.0_PLAN.md`:

- [x] `M0` baseline matrix + ownership map + checklist published (`governance/1.0.0_M0_BASELINE.md`).
- [ ] `M1` close remaining frozen-surface coverage gaps (owner: compiler/runtime/tooling).
- [x] `M2` canonical reference service migration completed and evidenced.
- [x] `M3` observability baseline completed and evidenced.
- [x] `M4` AOT default wiring completed and evidenced.
- [x] `M7` runtime contract hardening completed and evidenced.
- [x] `M8` production ergonomics completed and evidenced.
- [x] `M9` deployment surface formalization completed and evidenced.
- [x] `M10` AOT parity lock completed and evidenced.
- [x] `M5` docs sync/final sweep completed and evidenced.
- [ ] `M6` final release-candidate acceptance + contract status flip at `v1.0.0`.

Milestone PR link policy:

- For milestones already landed, evidence links are anchored to in-repo gate records in
  `governance/1.0.0_PLAN.md`.
- For open milestones (`M1`, `M6`), PR links are deferred to release branch cut tracking by release
  maintainers on `2026-02-28` (no blocker for M0 closure).

## Blocking Unknowns

None as of `2026-02-28`; remaining work is tracked, owned, and milestone-scoped (`M1`, `M6`).
