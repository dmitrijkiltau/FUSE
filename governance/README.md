# Governance Tier

This directory is the documentation-tier index for project identity, scope, and policy.

Canonical governance documents for the current pre-`1.0.0` line:

- [`scope.md`](scope.md) - project constraints, priorities, and non-goals
- [`1.0.0_M0_BASELINE.md`](1.0.0_M0_BASELINE.md) - M0 contract baseline matrix, ownership map, and tracking checklist
- [`1.0.0_M1_TEST_SLICES.md`](1.0.0_M1_TEST_SLICES.md) - M1 frozen-surface gap closure plan with concrete test PR slices
- [`IDENTITY_CHARTER.md`](IDENTITY_CHARTER.md) - language identity boundaries
- [`EXTENSIBILITY_BOUNDARIES.md`](EXTENSIBILITY_BOUNDARIES.md) - allowed extension surfaces
- [`VERSIONING_POLICY.md`](VERSIONING_POLICY.md) - compatibility and deprecation policy
- [`../GOVERNANCE.md`](../GOVERNANCE.md) - maintainer decision process
- [`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) - contributor workflow and quality bars

Conflict rule: identity disputes defer to `IDENTITY_CHARTER.md`.
