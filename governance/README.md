# Governance Tier

This directory is the documentation-tier index for project identity, scope, and policy.

Canonical governance documents for the current release line:

- [`scope.md`](scope.md) - project constraints, priorities, and non-goals
- [`IDENTITY_CHARTER.md`](IDENTITY_CHARTER.md) - language identity boundaries
- [`EXTENSIBILITY_BOUNDARIES.md`](EXTENSIBILITY_BOUNDARIES.md) - allowed extension surfaces
- [`VERSIONING_POLICY.md`](VERSIONING_POLICY.md) - compatibility and deprecation policy
- [`../GOVERNANCE.md`](../GOVERNANCE.md) - maintainer decision process
- [`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) - contributor workflow and quality bars

Conflict rule: identity disputes defer to `IDENTITY_CHARTER.md`.
