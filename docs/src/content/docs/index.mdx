# Fuse

Fuse is a typed, config-first language designed for small services and tools. It
prioritizes clear data shapes, predictable runtime behavior, and quick iteration
from definition to execution.

## Why Fuse

- **Typed data models**: structs, enums, refined constraints.
- **Config-first**: env + defaults, predictable overrides.
- **Service-ready**: minimal HTTP routing with typed JSON IO.
- **Fast feedback**: parse → check → run in seconds.

## Use cases

- Small JSON APIs and internal tools
- CLI utilities with validated inputs
- Prototypes that grow into production services
- Config-driven workers

## A tiny example

```
config App:
  port: Int = env("PORT") ?? 3000

type User:
  id: Id
  name: String(1..80)
  email: Email

service Users at "/api":
  get "/users/{id: Id}" -> User!NotFound:
    return NotFound(message="not found")

app "users":
  serve(App.port)
```
