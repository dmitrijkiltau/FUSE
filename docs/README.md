# FUSE Docs Package

This directory contains the docs app served by the `docs` package.

## Release Downloads

Downloads are published on GitHub Releases:

- https://github.com/dmitrijkiltau/FUSE/releases

## Run Docs Locally

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/generate_guide_docs.sh
./scripts/fuse run --manifest-path docs
```

Docs are served at <http://localhost:4080>.
Guide docs are not regenerated by `fuse run`/`fuse build` hooks; rerun
`./scripts/generate_guide_docs.sh` manually after changing `spec/` or `governance/` sources.

## Run Docs with Docker

The Docker build does not compile the FUSE CLI from source.
It downloads a pinned prebuilt Linux CLI artifact (`v0.7.0` by default) from GitHub Releases, then runs:

- `fuse build --manifest-path docs --release`

Guide docs are not regenerated during Docker build; committed generated docs are used.

The final runtime image contains only the built docs AOT binary plus static site assets/SVGs.
A `HEALTHCHECK` pings `/api/health` every 30 s.
Run these commands from the repository root.

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -f docs/Dockerfile -t fuse-docs:0.7.0 .
```

Optional: pin a specific release artifact URL:

```bash
docker build -f docs/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg FUSE_CLI_URL=https://github.com/dmitrijkiltau/FUSE/releases/download/v0.7.0/fuse-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz \
  -t fuse-docs:0.7.0 .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 4080:4080 -e PORT=4080 -e FUSE_HOST=0.0.0.0 fuse-docs:0.7.0
```

Or run with Compose (from the repository root):

```bash
docker compose --project-directory . -f docs/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

After the image is built once, start faster without rebuilding:

```bash
docker compose --project-directory . -f docs/docker-compose.yml up
```
