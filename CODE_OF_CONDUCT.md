# FUSE Code of Conduct

## Our standard

Participation in the FUSE project is expected to be respectful, constructive, and professional.

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful in language and tone.
- Focus on technical arguments and evidence.
- Assume good intent and ask clarifying questions before escalating.
- Keep reviews actionable: explain risks, expected behavior, and concrete fixes.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, threats, or personal attacks.
- Discriminatory or demeaning language.
- Repeated bad-faith engagement, trolling, or deliberate disruption.
- Publishing private information without consent.

## Scope

This applies to project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, code review) and any public context where a person is representing the project.

## Reporting and enforcement

- If safe, open an issue and label it `conduct` for moderator review.
- If private handling is needed, contact maintainers directly via GitHub.
- Maintainers may remove comments, lock threads, reject contributions, or ban participants for serious or repeated violations.

## Interpretation

Maintainers interpret and enforce this policy in good faith to preserve a healthy contributor environment.
