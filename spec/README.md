# Spec Tier

This directory is the documentation-tier index for normative language/runtime contracts.

Canonical spec documents for the active `v0.4.x` line:

- [`fls.md`](fls.md) - syntax, grammar, AST, and static semantics
- [`runtime.md`](runtime.md) - runtime and boundary semantics
- [`../ops/AOT_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md`](../ops/AOT_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md) - AOT production release contract and SLO gates
- [`1.0.0_STABILITY_CONTRACT.md`](1.0.0_STABILITY_CONTRACT.md) - proposed `1.x` stability contract and entry criteria
- [`../PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md) - execution milestones for satisfying the `1.0.0` contract

Conflict rule: for semantic behavior, `fls.md` and `runtime.md` are authoritative.
