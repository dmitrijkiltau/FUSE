# Spec Tier

This directory is the documentation-tier index for normative language/runtime contracts.

Canonical spec documents for the current release line:

- [`fls.md`](fls.md) - syntax, grammar, AST, and static semantics
- [`runtime.md`](runtime.md) - runtime and boundary semantics
- [`../governance/VERSIONING_POLICY.md`](../governance/VERSIONING_POLICY.md) - compatibility/versioning rules
- [`../ops/AOT_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md`](../ops/AOT_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md) - AOT production release contract and SLO gates
- [`../ops/RELEASE.md`](../ops/RELEASE.md) - release execution checklist and gates

Conflict rule: for semantic behavior, `fls.md` and `runtime.md` are authoritative.
