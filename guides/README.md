# Guides Tier

This directory is the documentation-tier index for onboarding and migration guides.

Guide-oriented documents currently live in these locations:

- [`../README.md`](../README.md) - repository front door and daily workflow
- [`fuse.md`](fuse.md) - product overview companion
- [`../docs/site/specs/onboarding.md`](../docs/site/specs/onboarding.md) - docs-site onboarding guide
- [`../docs/migrations/0.1-to-0.2.md`](../docs/migrations/0.1-to-0.2.md) - breaking-change migration guide
- [`../examples/README.md`](../examples/README.md) - example packages and usage notes

Conflict rule: guides are explanatory; normative behavior defers to the spec and runtime contracts.
